# ML Task Project

## Overview
This project involves working with machine learning tasks, and the notebook `ML_task.ipynb` contains the code for training, evaluating, and analyzing data. The dataset used in this project is essential for running the code and performing various operations, which must be uploaded manually.

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. **Upload the Dataset**
To get started with the notebook, you will need to upload the required dataset. Follow the steps below:

1. Open the `ML_task.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the following code to upload the dataset manually:

   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()
3.Select and upload the dataset file from your local machine. Once the dataset is uploaded, the notebook will be able to access it for further analysis.

# 2.Run the Code
After uploading the dataset, follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the machine learning pipeline. The notebook includes steps such as:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation and results
